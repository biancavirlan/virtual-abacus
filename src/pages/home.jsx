            <h1>Abacus</h1>

            <p>The Abacus (suan-pan in Chinese) also called a counting frame, is a calculating tool that was invented in Ancient China and in use for centuries before the adoption of the written modern numeral system and is still widely used by merchants, tradeers abd ckerks in Asia, Africa and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The Soroban is an abacus developed in Japan.It is dericed from the Chinese suan-pan, imported to Japan around 1600. Like the suan-pan, the soroban is still used today, despite the proliferation of practical and affordable pocket electronic calculators.</p>

            <h1>Mental Abacus</h1>
            <p>The abacus system of mental calculation is a system whre users mentally visualize an abacus to do calculations. No physical abacus is used; only the answers are written down. Calculations can be made at great speed in this way. For example, in the Flash Anzan event at the All Japan Soroban Championship, champion Takeo Sasano was able to add fifteen three-digit numbers in just 1.7 seconds.</p>
            <p>This system is being propagated in China, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Japan. Mental calculation is said to improve mental capability, increses speed of response, memory power and concentration power.</p>
            <p>Many veteran and prolific abacus users in China, Japan. South Korea and others who use the abacus daily, naturally tend to not use the abacus anymore but perform calculations by visualizing the abacus. This was verifed when the right brain measured heightened EEG activity when calculationg and compared with non-veterans who were using the abacus to perform calculations.</p>
            <p>The standard abacus can be ysed to perform addition, substraction, division and multiplication. The abacus can also be used to extract square-roots and cubic roots.</p>
